# Barbarian

## Lore
*Rogues are elusive combatants, defined by their agility, precision, and cunning. Mastering the arts of stealth, deception, and tactical strikes, rogues slip through shadows, exploit every weakness, and strike with deadly accuracy. They dominate the battlefield not through brute force, but through calculated moves, quick reflexes, and razor-sharp intellect.*

## Description
Rogues are cunning skirmishers who excel in precision strikes and stealth over brute strength. Instead of charging headlong into battle, they rely on agility, deception, and expert timing to outmaneuver their foes. With a keen eye for opportunity, rogues exploit vulnerabilities to deliver devastating sneak attacks and escape before their enemies can retaliate.

Rogues thrive on Dexterity for both offense and defense, using swift movements and quick reflexes to survive. They often avoid heavy armor, preferring speed, subtlety, and shadows to stay one step ahead of danger.

## Features
### Thieves' Cant (Level 1)
During your Rogue training you learned thieves' cant, a secret mix of dialect, jargon, and code that allows you to hide messages in seemingly normal conversation. Only another creature that knows thieves' cant understands such messages. It takes four times longer to convey such a message than it does to speak the same idea plainly.

In addition, you understand a set of secret signs and symbols used to convey short, simple messages, such as whether an area is dangerous or the territory of a thieves' guild, whether loot is nearby, or whether the people in an area are easy marks or will provide a safe house for thieves on the run.

### Sneak Attack (Level 1)
You know how to strike subtly and exploit a foe's distraction. Once per turn, you can deal an additional 1d8(melee)/1d4(ranged) extra damage to one creature you hit with an attack if you have advantage on the attack roll. The attack must use a finesse or a ranged weapon.

You can also make an additional sneak attack after reducing a target to 0 health. The damage of the sneak attack is increased by an additional damage die every 2 levels up to a maximum of 10d6.

### Cunning Action (Level 2)
Your quick thinking and agility allow you to move and act quickly. You can take a bonus action on each of your turns in combat. This action can be used only to take the Dash, Disengage, or Hide action.

### Rogue Expertise (Level 2)
Choose two of your skill proficiencies, or one of your skill proficiencies and your proficiency with thieves' tools. Your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make that uses either of the chosen proficiencies.

At 6th level, you can choose two more of your proficiencies (in skills or with thieves' tools) to gain this benefit.

### Rogue Evasion (Level 5) - (WIP)
You can nimbly dodge out of the way of certain area effects, such as a red dragon's fiery breath or an Ice Storm spell. When you are subjected to an effect that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw, and only half damage if you fail.

### Reliable Talent (Level 11)
You have refined your chosen skills until they approach perfection. Whenever you make an ability check that lets you add your proficiency bonus, you can treat a d20 roll of 9 or lower as a 10.

### Rogue Blindsense (Level 14) - (WIP)
If you are able to hear, you are aware of the location of any hidden or invisible creature within 10 feet of you.

### Slippery Mind (Level 15) - (WIP)
You have acquired greater mental strength. You gain proficiency in Wisdom saving throws.

### Elusive (Level 18) - (WIP)
You are so evasive that attackers rarely gain the upper hand against you. No attack roll has advantage against you while you aren't incapacitated.

### Stroke of Luck (Level 20) - (WIP)
You have an uncanny knack for succeeding when you need to. If your attack misses a target within range, you can turn the miss into a hit. Alternatively, if you fail an ability check, you can treat the d20 roll as a 20.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.
