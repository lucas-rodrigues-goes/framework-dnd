# Cleric

## Lore
*Wizards are supreme magic-users, defined and united as a class by the spells they cast. Drawing on the subtle weave of magic that permeates the cosmos, wizards cast spells of explosive fire, arcing lightning, subtle deception, brute-force mind control, and much more.*

## Description
Wizards are arcane casters who are capable of providing excelent utility and decent damage, but at the cost of being very fragile. A wizard can learn spells as they come across scrolls and spellbooks in their adventures, but can only memorize a portion of these every day. 

Wizards rely on their Intelligence score for their spells. They have few features but truly shine in the variety of their spellcasting. They usually have little to no martial training.

## Features
### Wizard Spellcasting (Level 1)
As a student of arcane magic, you have access to Wizard spells. 

Spells can be learned by scribing scrolls, from other Wizard's spellbooks, and by leveling up. To cast spells you need to memorize them and have a spell slot of sufficient level available. When long resting you can memorize a total of spells equal to your Intelligence modifier + your wizard level, and you also regain your spent spell slots. 

Cantrips are spells that do not cost resources to cast, and don't need to be prepared. Spells with the ritual tag can also be cast without cost, but using a casting time of 10 minutes instead of the regular speed.

Spell Focuses are needed for most spells, as a Wizard you may use an Arcane Focus.

### Arcane Recovery (Level 1)
You have a number of Arcane Recovery charges equal to your Wizard level, that are regained whenever you finish a long rest. As an action you can regain spell slots of 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, or 5th level by spending 2, 3, 5, 6, or 7 charges respectively.

### Signature Spells (Level 18) - (WIP)
You have achieved such mastery over certain spells that you can cast them at will. Choose a 1st-level Wizard spell that you know. This spell becomes innate for you, it is always prepared and costs nothing to cast.

On levels 19 and 20, you can choose a 2nd level spell and a 3rd level spell respectively to become additional signature spells.
