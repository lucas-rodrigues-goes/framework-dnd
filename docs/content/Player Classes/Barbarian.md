# Barbarian

## Lore
*Barbarians are primal warriors, defined by their fierce rage and unyielding endurance. Channeling the untamed fury of the wilderness or their ancestral spirits, barbarians unleash devastating blows, shrug off mortal wounds, and dominate the battlefield through raw physical power and indomitable will.*

## Description
Barbarians are brutal combatants who excel in close-quarters combat, trading defense for  overwhelming offense. While raging, they deal massive damage and resist harm, but their  power wanes as their fury fades. Barbarians grow stronger by embracing their primal instincts,  gaining supernatural resilience and ferocity as they master their rage.

Barbarians rely on Strength for attacks and Constitution for survival. They typically abstain from heavy armor, trusting their toughened bodies and battle instincts to protect them.

## Features
### Barbarian Toughness (Level 1)
While you are not wearing any armor, your Armor Class equals 10 + your Dexterity modifier + your Constitution modifier. You can use a shield and still gain this benefit.

### Rage (Level 1)
In battle, you fight with primal ferocity. On your turn, you can enter a rage as a bonus action.

Your rage lasts for 1 minute. It ends early if you are knocked unconscious or if you haven't attacked a hostile creature or taken damage since your last turn. You can also end your rage on your turn as a bonus action.

While raging, you can't cast or concentrate on spells and you gain the following benefits if you aren't wearing heavy armor:

- You have advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws.

- When you make a melee weapon attack using Strength, you gain a +2 bonus to the damage roll. This bonus increases by 2 on levels 9 and 16.

- Bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage you receive is reduced by 3. The reduction increases by 3 on levels 5, 11, and 17.

### Reckless Attack (Level 2)
You can throw aside all concern for defense to attack with fierce desperation. You can decide to attack recklessly. Doing so gives you advantage on melee weapon attack rolls using Strength for one round, but attack rolls against you have advantage until the effect ends.

### Barbaric Movement (Level 5)
Your speed increases by 10 feet while you aren't wearing heavy armor.

### Extra Attack (Level 5)
You can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.

### Feral Instinct (Level 7) - (WIP)
Your instincts are so honed that you have advantage on initiative rolls.

### Brutal Critical (Level 9) - (WIP)
Your critical multiplier is increased by 1x when determining the extra damage for a critical hit with a melee attack.

This increases to an increase of 2x at 13th level and 3x at 17th level.

### Relentless Rage (Level 11) - (WIP)
Your rage can keep you fighting despite grievous wounds. If you drop to 0 hit points while you're raging and don't die outright, you can make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw. If you succeed, you drop to 1 hit point instead.

Each time you use this feature after the first, the DC increases by 5. When you finish a short or long rest, the DC resets to 10.

### Persistent Rage (Level 15) - (WIP)
Your rage is so fierce that it ends early only if you fall unconscious or if you choose to end it.

### Indomitable Might (Level 18) - (WIP)
If your total for a Strength check is less than your Strength score, you can use that score in place of the total.

### Primal Champion (Level 20) - (WIP)
You embody the power of the wilds. Your Strength and Constitution scores increase by 4. Your maximum for those scores is now 24.
