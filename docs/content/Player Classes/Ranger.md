# Ranger

## Lore
*Rangers are wanderers of the wilds, shaped by harsh terrain, constant travel, and deep familiarity with the creatures that inhabit the wilderness. Their instincts, training, and bond with nature turn them into expert trackers and hunters.*

## Description
Rangers are agile combatants who mix weapon mastery with nature-driven magic. They specialize in scouting, tracking enemies, and controlling the battlefield through mobility and precision. Their spellcasting enhances their senses, movement, and attacks rather than providing raw magical power. 

Rangers rely on Wisdom for their magic and typically fight with bows, agile weapons, or paired blades. Their strengths come from tracking techniques, intense enemy study, and battlefield awareness.

### Ranger Spellcasting (Level 2)
You have learned to use the magical essence of nature to cast spells, much as a Druid does.

As you gain levels in this class you will learn new spells. Spells cost spell slots of their level to cast, you regain all your spent spell slots when you long rest.

At level 3 you can acquire a beast of up to CR 1/4, increasing to CR 1/2 at level 5, CR 1 at level 7 and CR 2 at level 15.

### Roving
Your walking speed increases by 5, and you gain a climbing speed and a swimming speed equal to your walking speed.

### Land's Stride (Level 8) - (WIP)
Moving through nonmagical difficult terrain costs you no extra movement. You can also pass through nonmagical plants without being slowed by them and without taking damage from them if they have thorns, spines, or a similar hazard.

In addition, you have advantage on saving throws against plants that are magically created or manipulated to impede movement, such as those created by the Entangle spell.

### Nature's Veil (Level 10) - (WIP)
You draw on the powers of nature to hide yourself from view briefly. As a bonus action, you can magically become invisible, along with any equipment you are wearing or carrying, for up to 5 rounds.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your wisdom modifier, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

### Tireless (Level 10)
As an action, you can give yourself a number of temporary hit points equal to 1d8 + your Wisdom modifier (minimum of 1 temporary hit point). You can use this action up to 3 times, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

In addition, whenever you finish a short rest, your exhaustion level, if any, is decreased by 1.

### Vanish (Level 14) - (WIP)
You can use the Hide action as a bonus action on your turn. Also, you can't be tracked by nonmagical means, unless you choose to leave a trail.
