# Cleric

## Lore
*Clerics are intermediaries between the mortal world and the distant planes of the gods. As varied as the gods they serve, clerics strive to embody the handiwork of their deities. No ordinary priest, a cleric is imbued with divine magic.*

## Description
Clerics are divine agents of their deities, wielding holy magic to heal, protect, and smite foes. They are versatile spellcasters, capable of bolstering allies, turning undead, and calling upon their god's wrath. Unlike other casters, clerics prepare spells each day from their entire class list, making them adaptable to any challenge.

Clerics rely on their Wisdom score for spellcasting and often wear sturdy armor, allowing them to stand firm in battle while supporting their allies with divine power. Their strength comes not just from their spells, but from their unshakable faith.

## Features
### Cleric Spellcasting (Level 1)
As a conduit for divine power, you can cast Cleric spells. 

You prepare the list of Cleric spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the Cleric spell list. When you do so, choose a number of Cleric spells equal to your Wisdom modifier + your Cleric level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. You regain all your spent spell slots when you long rest.

Cantrips are spells that do not cost resources to cast, and don't need to be prepared. Spells with the ritual tag can also be cast without cost, but using a casting time of 10 minutes instead of the regular speed.

Spell Focuses are needed for most spells, as a Wizard you may use a holy symbol.

### Channel Divinity (Level 2) - (WIP)
You gain the ability to channel divine energy directly from your deity, using that energy to fuel magical effects. You start with two such effects: Turn Undead and an effect determined by your domain. Some domains grant you additional effects as you advance in levels, as noted in the domain description.

When you use your Channel Divinity, you choose which effect to create. You must then finish a short or long rest to use your Channel Divinity again.

Some Channel Divinity effects require saving throws. When you use such an effect from this class, the DC equals your Cleric spell save DC.

Beginning at 6th level, you can use your Channel Divinity twice between rests, and beginning at 18th level, you can use it three times between rests. When you finish a short or long rest, you regain your expended uses.

### Channel Divnity: Turn Undead (Level 2) - (WIP)
As an action, you present your holy symbol and speak a prayer censuring the undead. Each undead that can see or hear you within 30 feet of you must make a Wisdom saving throw. If the creature fails its saving throw, it is turned for 1 minute or until it takes any damage.

A turned creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can't willingly move to a space within 30 feet of you. It also can't take reactions. For its action, it can use only the Dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If there's nowhere to move, the creature can use the Dodge action.

### Destroy Undead (Level 5) - (WIP)
When an undead of CR 1/2 or lower fails its saving throw against your Turn Undead feature, the creature is instantly destroyed.

### Divine Intervention (Level 10)
You can call on your deity to intervene on your behalf when your need is great.

Imploring your deity's aid requires you to use your action. Describe the assistance you seek, and roll percentile dice. If you roll a number equal to or lower than your Cleric level, your deity intervenes. The DM chooses the nature of the intervention; the effect of any Cleric spell or Cleric domain spell would be appropriate. If your deity intervenes, you can't use this feature again for 7 days. Otherwise, you can use it again after you finish a long rest.

At 20th level, your call for intervention succeeds automatically, no roll required.
