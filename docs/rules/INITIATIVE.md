# Initiative System

The initiative system is designed around these core goals:

- Provide **variable initiative every round** that remains **predictable**, while maintaining **1 action per 6 seconds**.
- Allow **non-casters** to interrupt spellcasting (instead of only *Counterspell* as in 5e).
- Make actions such as **Dash**, **Dodge**, and **Disengage** **less punishing**.
- Reduce the **frustration of being incapacitated**.

The system revolves around three concepts: **Offset**, **Recovery Time**, and **Casting Time**.  
Initiative is measured in **0.5-second increments** (double for seconds).  
Having the **lowest initiative** means you're the next to act, but this does **not** mean its the start of your *round*.

## Offset

Offset defines the start of a creature’s 6-second round.

- **Round 1:**  
  Offset is determined by:  
  **1d6 (Reaction Roll) + Initiative Penalty**  
  *Initiative penalty comes from armor and shields (0–3).*

- **Subsequent Rounds:**  
  A creature’s Offset increases by a **fixed 12** (equivalent to 6 seconds).

This means everyone has their own "round timeline” that cycles every 6 seconds but does *not* synchronize with other creatures.


## Recovery Time

Recovery Time represents how long you take to recover from an action.

- Different weapons have different Recovery Times.  
  Example:  
  - **Dagger** → Recovery 1 (you act again 0.5s into your next round)  
  - **Greataxe** → Recovery 7 (you act again 3.5s into your next round)

- Some actions, such as **Dash**, have **no Recovery Time**.

Recovery Time determines how far into your *next* round you will act after performing an action.


## Casting Time

Casting a spell increases your **current initiative** by the spell’s Casting Time.

Important characteristics:

- **Does not modify your Offset**.
- **Does not assign Recovery Time**.
- You are still within your current 6-second round, you're simply delaying the moment your spell resolves.

This simulates "charging” or "casting" without changing your next round’s starting position.


## In Short

Rounds are still **6 seconds**, but each creature has **its own round timing**.

Example:

- A creature whose round begins **2 seconds** into combat will always have the start of their round be **1 second earlier** than one whose round begins **3 seconds** into combat.
- Both still act **once every 6 seconds**, but at **different Offsets**.

This creates a **dynamic, flowing initiative system** where timing matters, interrupts are meaningful, and turns interact more naturally.
