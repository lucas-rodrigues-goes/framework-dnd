      "description": "Ability Score Increase: Your Dexterity score increases by 2 and your Intelligence score increases by 1.\n\nDarkvision: You can see in dim light within 30 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.\n\nFey Ancestry: You have advantage on saving throws against being charmed, and magic can't put you to sleep.\n\nTrance: Elves do not sleep. Instead they meditate deeply, remaining semi-conscious, for 4 hours a day. The Common word for this meditation is \"trance.\" While meditating, you dream after a fashion; such dreams are actually mental exercises that have become reflexive after years of practice. After resting in this way, you gain the same benefit a human would from 8 hours of sleep.\n\nKeen Senses: You have proficiency in the Perception skill.\n\nLanguages: You can speak, read, and write Common and Elven.\n\nElven Cantrip: You know one cantrip of your choice from the Wizard spell list. Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for it.\n\nExtra Language: You can read, speak, and write one additional language of your choice."
