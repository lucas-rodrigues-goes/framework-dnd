# D&D Framework for MapTool

This framework aims to provide an automated D&D experience for **MapTool**, offering a more game-like experience for both players and the DM. Although it is heavily based on **D&D 5e core rules**, it incorporates many homebrew systems that would be cumbersome to manage manually (most, if not all, of these are combat-related).  

## Current Features

- **Character Creation**  
- **Interactive Character Sheet**  
- **Drag-and-Drop Inventory**  
- **Spell Learning and Memorization** for single- and multi-class characters  
- **Journal/Notes Entries** for every token *(WIP)*  
- **Automated Actions, Abilities, and Spells** displayed through an **Action Bar HUD**  
- **Automated Initiative** (Homebrew System)  
- **Calendar and Time Tracking** with an automatic day-night cycle based on the current hour.
