# D&D Framework for MapTool

This framework aims to create an intuitive system for DMs that allow somewhat easy addition of new items/features/classes/races. While providing intuitive screens that should be more game-like, to offer an easier experience for both veteran players and newcomers.

## Main Goals

- A database with easy access and editing of player classes, races, conditions, features, items, spells and more.
- Character sheet, inventory, journal, and abilities/spells page for players.
- Dynamic day/night switching through an in-game clock (that is advanced as rounds go on, or at GMs control).
- Easy addition of mp3 files to Maptool for ambience, music, etc (Integration using [JUH's MTScripts](https://forums.rptools.net/viewtopic.php?t=29143)).
- Code that is easier to read/modify for those wanting to make their own thing from this framework (This project is being written in JavaScript, instead of MTScript).
